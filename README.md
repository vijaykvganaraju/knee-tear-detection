### Dataset Details

The most common indications for the knee MRI examinations in this study included acute and chronic pain, follow-up or preoperative evaluation, injury/trauma. Examinations were performed with GE scanners (GE Discovery, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) with standard knee MRI coil and a routine non-contrast knee MRI protocol that included the following sequences: coronal T1 weighted, coronal T2 with fat saturation, sagittal proton density (PD) weighted, sagittal T2 with fat saturation, and axial PD weighted with fat saturation. A total of 775 (56.6%) examinations used a 3.0-T magnetic field; the remaining used a 1.5-T magnetic field.
